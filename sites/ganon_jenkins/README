## Public testing for Flash-X

The current location of the jenkins server that is running tests is: ganon2.device.utk.edu:8080

## Using benchmarks

Running tests that compare against an approved benchmark can be implemented by adding comparison
tests to `Comparision.suite` and adding the date stamp of the approved benchmark using `-cbase`.

The benchmarks should be available as compressed tar files. See following files for example:
