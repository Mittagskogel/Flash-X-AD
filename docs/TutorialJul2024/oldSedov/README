Simulation_initBlock_Fx.F90 and Simulation_initBlock_F4.F90 are
meant to be viewed side by side. Thy represent (with a few changes)
implementations of a quite complex version of Simulation_initBlock.F90
for the Sedov problem.

* Simulation_initBlock_Fx.F90 - new (Flash-X) code
* Simulation_initBlock_F4.F90 - old (FLASH) code

Loading both files in emacs and then using `ediff-buffers'
(and optionally using the `~' key) is one way of doing it.
