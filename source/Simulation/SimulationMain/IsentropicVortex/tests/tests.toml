## Isentropic Composite Tests 
#  This is a hydro test with periodic boundary conditions and runs only in 2D
#  it preserves the vortices, they just move around in the domain

#### Keywords  Particles, Hydro, Cartesian/2D

#### Motivation
# This test was designed to verify that tracer particles move
# correctly through the domain. It is meaningful only if run on numProcs 4 or more

#### Variants
# There are three variants of test
# AMReX for Grid, unsplit for Hydro
# AMReX for Grid, spark for Hydro
# Paramesh for Grid, unsplit for Hydro\
# UG for Grid, unsplit for Hydro -- this test will run only on 4 procs.


#### Success vs. Failure
# This is a composite test therefore has two baseline files. The first file
# flashx_hdf5_chk_0001 is used as comparison test to ensure correct running, the
# second file flashx_hdf5_chk_0002 is used to ensure that restart is transparent
