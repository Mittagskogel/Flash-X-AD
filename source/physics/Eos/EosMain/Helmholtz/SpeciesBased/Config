D eos_singleSpeciesA  Single-species nucleon number for the gas 
D &         (only used by Eos/Helmholtz when compiled w/o Multispecies)
PARAMETER eos_singleSpeciesA         REAL    1.00  [0.0 to ]
D eos_singleSpeciesZ  Single-species proton number for the gas  
D &         (only used Eos/Helmholtz when compiled w/o Multispecies)
PARAMETER eos_singleSpeciesZ         REAL    1.00  [0.0 to ]

# Since we cannot use EXCLUSIVE to limit only one EOS implementation
# since Hybrid needs multiple ones, the following PPDEFINE will
# be used in the non-hybrid Eos.F90 to perform a compile time check
# that only this implementation has been loaded if the Hybrid EOS has not
PPDEFINE EOS_HELM_SPECIESBASED_INCLUDED
