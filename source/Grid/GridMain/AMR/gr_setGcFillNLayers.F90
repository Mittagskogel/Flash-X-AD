!! NAME
!!
!!  gr_setGcFillNLayers
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  gr_setGcFillNLayers(integer(OUT)  :: layers(MDIM),
!!                      integer(IN)  :: idir,
!!                      integer(IN)  :: guard,
!!                      integer(IN),OPTIONAL  :: minlayers,
!!                      integer(OUT),OPTIONAL :: returnLayers(MDIM))
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!   Given a caller's required number of guard cell layers that need
!!   to be filled, this routine determines the values of nlayers{x,y,z}
!!   in the call to amr_guardcell.
!!
!!   The numbers of layers requested from Paramesh are alway at
!!   least as many as those required by the caller, but may be
!!   larger for two reasons:
!!    o  to ensure that parent blocks have enough guard cells with
!!       valid data to allow interpolation into their chiildren's
!!       guard cells (this depends on the interpolation method's 
!!       stencil); and/or
!!    o  to ensure that alignment reqirements of the interpolation
!!       method are satisfied ("monotonic" interpolation requires
!!       the child cell ranges to start at odd indices).
!!
!!   This subroutine is meant to be called from Grid_fillGuardCells.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!   layers : returns value to pass to amr_guardcell as nlayersx/y/z argument
!!
!!
!!   idir :     selects a direction (or not) - interpreted as for Grid_fillGuardCells.
!!
!!   guard :    max number of layers possible - should probably always be the same
!!              as NGUARD.
!!
!!   minlayers : selects (or not) minimum number of guard cells *that the caller needs*,
!!               interpreted as for Grid_fillGuardCells.
!!
!!   returnLayers: if present, this array will on return simply contain the
!!               requested number of layers for each direction.
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!   Currently this subroutine is only used in Paramesh 3 ff. versions of
!!   Grid_fillGuardCells and in Multigrid Poisson solvers.
