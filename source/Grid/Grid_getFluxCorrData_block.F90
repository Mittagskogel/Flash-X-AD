!! NAME

!!  Grid_getFluxCorrData_block
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call Grid_getFluxCorrData_block(type(Grid_tile_t)(in) :: blockDesc,
!!                              real(OUT),TARGET      :: fluxBufX(:,lo(1): ,lo(2): ,lo(3): ),
!!                              real(OUT),TARGET      :: fluxBufY(:,lo(1): ,lo(2): ,lo(3): ),
!!                              real(OUT),TARGET      :: fluxBufZ(:,lo(1): ,lo(2): ,lo(3): ),
!!                              integer(in)           :: lo(3),
!!                              logical(IN), OPTIONAL :: isFluxDensity(:))
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!   Get flux corrections from semipermanent flux storage (SPFS).
!!
!!    fluxBuf := "communicated fine fluxes" - "saved coarse fluxes"  AT coarse side of f/c bdry;
!!            :=  0.0                                                ELSEWHERE.
!!
!!   Only fluxes at locations that represent the coarse side of fine/coarse
!!   block boundaries can hold nonzero flux correction data on return.
!!   Other elements of the flux buffers are set to zero if they represent
!!   faces of any cells that touch a block boundary; data faces of cells
!!   that are farther away from a block boundary should be considered undefined.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!   blockDesc : describes the current block.
!!               Note that this should be a full block, not a tile representing
!!               a partial block.
!!
!!   fluxBufX :  buffer for flux correction (difference) in IAXIS-direction
!!
!!   fluxBufY :  buffer for  flux correction (difference) in JAXIS-direction;
!!               output should be considered undefined if NDIM < 2.
!!
!!   fluxBufZ :  buffer for  flux correction (difference) in KAXIS-direction;
!!               output should be considered undefined if NDIM < 3.
!!
!!   lo :        lower bounds for the spatial indices of the flux buffers
!!
!!   isFluxDensity : indicates, for each flux component, whether the component
!!                   is a flux proper (if TRUE) or a flux density (otherwise).
!!                   This may be either removed, or changed into a scalar flag,
!!                   later.
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!   The arrays fluxBufX, fluxBufY, fluxBufZ are subject to index reordering.
!!
!!   flux buffer arrays should contain space for fluxes of all valid cells
!!   in the block, excluding guard cells.
!!
!!   This interface does not require level-wide fluxes to be allocated.
!!
!!   SPFS means semi-permanent flux storage. When using a Grid
!!   implementation based on AMReX, SPFS is implemented by an AMReX
!!   flux register class, such as FlashFluxRegister, possibly in
!!   combination with some auxiliary storage.
